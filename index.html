            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more
            so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

              I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
              transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
              for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
              The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
              the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
              startup.

              I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile
              engineer for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself.

            Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from
            them and learning from their experiences was easy.

              The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing.
              The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and
              present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will
              get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing
              people.

              Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some
              structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was
              encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things
              about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
              hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
              particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
              tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
              example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
              developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!
